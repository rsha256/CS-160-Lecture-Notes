\subsection{Information Visualization, Design Patterns}
Verbal Notes not given in lecture slides:
\begin{itemize}
    \item EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis is used for performing critical investigations in data to find patterns
    \item Start with Color/Orientation/Shape so you're not that constrained for adding O/Q features in the future
    \item Delta Stimulus
    \item Loudness = approx 6.5
    \item Heaviness and taste greater than 1 $\implies$ we overestimate those sensations.
    \item Certain Visual Variables are better for comparisons.
\end{itemize}
